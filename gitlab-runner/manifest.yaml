Description: |
 [v0.2.0]
 If you are using self-managed GitLab or you want to use your own runners on GitLab.com, you can install and configure your own runners. This script will automatically install the GitLab runner on a VM and register it with your GitLab instance using a token. The VM will use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) amd64 as its operating system. For more information about GitLab runners, see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/.
